# GANs for 2D Data & Sketch Generation

This repository contains two mini-projects that demonstrate the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in generating:

1. Synthetic 2D data (e.g., sine waves and noisy parametric curves)
2. Hand-drawn smiley face sketches from the QuickDraw dataset using a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)

## Overview

This project is part of an academic assignment exploring how GANs can learn and synthesize data patterns through adversarial training. It involves:

- Implementing a GAN from scratch in PyTorch for 2D curve generation
- Training a DCGAN to generate smiley faces from QuickDraw vector sketches
- Visualizing and comparing real vs. fake samples
- Documenting training progression and GAN performance
